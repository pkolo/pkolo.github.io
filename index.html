			<h3>Welcome!</h3>
			<p>There are many ways to roast coffee at home. This page is dedicated to the "Dog Bowl Heat Gun" method. It's a clumsy, unappealing name, but I assure you that it's a simple, low-cost way of having freshly roasted coffee on a regular basis.</p>

			<h3>What You'll Need</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Heat Gun</strong> - A handheld, hairdryer-like tool that is capable of extremely high temperatures, available online or at most hardware stores. You will need one that can get up to at least 500&deg; F.</li>

				<li><strong>Stainless Steel Bowl</strong> - A dog-bowl style bowl, with a steep-sloped inside is preferred, but a mixing bowl would also work.</li>

				<li><strong>Trivet</strong> - Or anything non-heat-conductive that will help the bowl stay still while stirring.</li>

				<li><strong>Stirring Utensil</strong> - A wooden spoon works well.</li>

				<li><strong>Green Coffee Beans</strong> - Of course, you'll need some beans to roast. <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Maria's</a> is an excellent place to buy them.</li>
			</ul>
