					<h3>About My Page</h3>
					<p>Hello! My name is Patrick, and I am a member of the 2016 Chipmunks DBC cohort. I have created this page to demonstrate baseline proficiency in HTML and CSS. Time isn't exactly on my side here, so bear with me! I recognize the aesthetic flaws, and surely could spend days tweaking everything, but at the moment this thing is functioning pretty well in my <span class="humble">humble</span> opinion :) Anyway, even if I spent days on it I'd still have a pretty useless site with bad info on it.</p>

					<h3>Resources</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Maria's</a> - A great online shop for green coffee beans. They source beans from all over the world. Many are similar in quality to the ones used by your favorite local roaster, available for a fraction of the price!</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.homeroaster.com/intro1.html" target="_blank">Homeroaster</a> - An excellent resource for home roasting, with clear, easy to follow, and very specific instructions on many methods of home roasting-- much better than the content you see here. It sports an old-school HTML design. It is a great example of the kind of website the DBC Chipmunks could already build with the few HTML elements we've learned thus far-- head, title, body, tables, links, etc. There are a few in-line body and font styling attributes (bgcolor, link, color, face, etc) that we'll probably never use (at least in this form), because we'll presumably be doing all that with CSS! I think that this style is perfectly fine for a personal page, especially one on a DIY topic, and when the content is very useful! But I suppose an updated design might make it a bit more navigable.</p>

					<h3>Welcome!</h3>
					<p>Although premium, locally roasted coffee is more accessible than ever, the best, and cheapest way to have freshly-roasted coffee at home is DIY roasting! There are many ways to roast your own coffee at home. This page is dedicated to the "Dog Bowl Heat Gun" method. It's a clumsy, unappealing name, but I assure you that it's a simple, low-cost way of having freshly roasted coffee on a regular basis.</p>	
				</section>

					<h3>What You'll Need</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Heat Gun</strong> - A handheld, hairdryer-like tool that is capable of extremely high temperatures, available online or at most hardware stores. You will need one that can get up to at least 500&deg; F.</li>

						<li><strong>Stainless Steel Bowl</strong> - A dog-bowl style bowl, with a steep-sloped inside is preferred, but a mixing bowl would also work.</li>

						<li><strong>Cork Trivet</strong> - Or anything non-heat-conductive that will help the bowl stay still while stirring.</li>

						<li><strong>Stirring Utensil</strong> - A wooden spoon works well.</li>

						<li><strong>Green Coffee Beans</strong> - Of course, you'll need some beans to roast. <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Maria's</a> is an excellent place to buy them.</li>

						<li><strong>Mesh Bowl</strong> - For cooling the beans. You could also use a colander.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>The Basic Technique</h3>
					<p>Find a well-ventilated area, place the bowl on the trivet, then fill it with 1-3 cups of green beans, depending on the size of the bowl and the desired batch.</p>
					<p>Next, and turn the heat gun to its low setting, and hold it over the beans at a very close (1-2 inch) range.</p>
					<p>Keeping the heat gun relatively still, stir the beans as evenly and constantly as possible. Beans can burn very quickly if they sit under the heat gun for too long, so want to keep them moving rather quickly without sending too many over the sides of the bowl.</p>
					<p>Keep doing this until you achieve your desired roast. The main ways to determine this are by the color and sound of the roast. Depending on your heat gun temperature, your roast should begin to loudly at roughly 7 minutes into the roasting process. This is referred to as "first crack" and it generally means that you have reached a "light" or "city" roast. If you keep the roast going for a few more minutes, you will start to hear a softer "pop" sound. This is called "second crack," and generally means you've reached a "dark" or "full city" roast. Be careful roasting after second crack, unless you want a very dark roast. Your coffee will burn very quickly after this point.</p>
