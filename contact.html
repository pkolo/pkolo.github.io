				<p>Although premium, locally roasted coffee is more accessible than ever, the best, and cheapest way to have freshly-roasted coffee at home is DIY roasting! There are many ways to roast your own coffee at home. This page is dedicated to the "Dog Bowl Heat Gun" method. It's a clumsy, unappealing name, but I assure you that it's a simple, low-cost way of having freshly roasted coffee on a regular basis.</p>

				<h3>Resources</h3>
				<p><a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Maria's</a> - A great online shop for green coffee beans. They source beans from all over the world. Many are similar in quality to the ones used by your favorite local roaster, available for a fraction of the price!</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.homeroaster.com/intro1.html" target="_blank">Homeroaster</a> - An excellent resource for home roasting, with clear, easy to follow, and very specific instructions on many methods of home roasting-- much better than the content you see here. It sports an old-school HTML design. It is a great example of the kind of website the DBC Chipmunks could already build with the few HTML elements we've learned thus far-- head, title, body, tables, links, etc. There are a few in-line body and font styling attributes (bgcolor, link, color, face, etc) that we'll probably never use (at least in this form), because we'll presumably be doing all that with CSS! I think that this style is perfectly fine for a personal page, especially one on a DIY topic, and when the content is very useful! But I suppose an updated design might make it a bit more navigable.</p>
